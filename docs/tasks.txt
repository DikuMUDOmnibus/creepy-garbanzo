NEW OBJECT SAVE:
================
refactor: Values array - save simple numeric values. Evaluate by item type right after loading. (see db.c load_objects and olc_save save_objects) 
refactor: affect_data object file (create, clone, serialize, etc).
refactor: extra_descr_data object file 
refactor: after affect_data and extra_descr, remove recycle.h from objectprototype
missing: extra clone in objectprototype->clone
bug: cloning an object to a new area might cause breakage when the new object is set in ch->desc->edit_data
refeature: character_service.c:look_extras  re-enable looking at room extras.
refeature: order of precedence in look_extras seems to suck.

FIXING COMBAT:
==============
Save/load affect level with object. (right now hard-coded to 1).
Replace weapon flags that cause damage with effects (shock, flaming, etc). Also curse and other ITEM_ flags.


Override descriptions for corpses and body parts (fight.c). D'OH!
Override descriptions for money (handler.c). D'OH!
Fact of prompt to be displayed is not saved (or maybe a copyover issue).

?Weapon skills added to thief don't ever stick.
?Weapon skills added to mage only stick if it is last add.

Object constraints (things like min-level, race, class, etc).
Randomize object cost during creation.
Gods feature is incomplete.
