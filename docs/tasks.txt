FIXING COMBAT:
==============
Save/load affect level with object. (right now hard-coded to 1).
Replace weapon flags that cause damage with effects (shock, flaming, etc). Also curse and other ITEM_ flags.


Override descriptions for corpses and body parts (fight.c). D'OH!
Override descriptions for money (handler.c). D'OH!
Fact of prompt to be displayed is not saved (or maybe a copyover issue).

?Weapon skills added to thief don't ever stick.
?Weapon skills added to mage only stick if it is last add.

Object constraints (things like min-level, race, class, etc).
Randomize object cost during creation.
Gods feature is incomplete.
