`&"``Alone`&"``

I scream at the sky`&,`` it`&'``s easier than crying
I`&'``m shyist when I`&'``m shouting out loud
I feel so alone in a room full of people
I`&'``m loudist when I`&'``m in a crowd
I`&'``m alone`&,`` and nobody hears me
Can`&'``t nobody heal me`&,`` won`&'``t somebody help me
I`&'``m alone`&,`` I just need
Someone to take my hand and pick me up when I`&'``m feeling down

Someone to take my heart and give it a home
Someone to be with me and help me through the times when I`&'``m
    down and lonely
Someone to be with me when I`&'``m alone
I`&'``m alone`&,`` all alone
Alone is the way I live`&,`` it`&'``s not the way I want it but you know
You can`&'``t give in`&,`` alone is the way I feel`&,``
    It`&'``s so hard to understand
Why I`&'``ve got to be alone

`1Chorus`&:``
If you look in my heart you`&'``d see it
I`&'``m trying to be something better
If you look in my heart you`&'``d feel it
I`&'``ve got to keep moving on
If you look in my heart you`&'``d know it
I`&'``m just trying to make my world better

If you look in my heart you`&'``d see it
I got to do it alone

I`&'ve been down`&,`` I`&'``ve been down
I`&'``ve been down`&,`` down`&,`` down so low
I`&'``ve been lost`&,`` so lost with no place left to go
I`&'``ve had emotions`&,`` emotions that you better hope you never know
Sometimes it feels like I just can`&'``t take no more

`1Chorus``

Seems like things just keep getting further out of hand
Why can`&'``t for once things just go as I plan
How dare you`&,`` how dare you tell me that you understand
Let me tell you straight out`&,`` there ain`&'``t nobody here that can
I`&'``m all alone`&,`` I`&'``m so alone`&,`` to be alone`&,`` just leave me alone

If you look in my heart you`&'``ll see it
If you look in my heart you`&'``d feel it
If you look in my heart you`&'``d know it
I`&'``m not trying to make no one bitter
I`&'``m just alone`&,`` leave me alone`&,`` alone`&,`` alone`&,`` now leave me

I`&'``ve lived in places that you wouldn`&'``t never ever want to be
Places where for a minute you couldn`&'``t ever stand to be
I`&'``ve seen things`&,`` I`&'``ve seen things you`&'``d never want to see
So what gives`&,`` what gives you the right to be the judge of me`&?``
I`&'``m all alone`&,`` I`&'``m so alone`&,`` to be alone`&,`` just leave me alone

A room full of people`&,`` can`&'``t nobody hear me`&,`` can`&'``t nobody
    help me`&,`` I`&'``m alone
I just need someone to take my hand and pick me up when I`&'``m 
    feeling down`&,`` when I`&'``m down
Someone to take my heart and give it a home`&,`` 
Someone to be with me and help me through the times when
    I`&'``m down and lonely`&,`` 
Someone to be with me when I`&'``m alone
I`&'``m alone`&,`` all alone
Alone is the way I live`&,`` it`&'``s not the way I want it`&,`` but I
    know I can`&'``t give in
Alone is the way I feel`&,`` there ain`&'``t nothing quite as sad as
    a person that`&'``s alone
