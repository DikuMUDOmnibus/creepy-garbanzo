You are standing in a tranquil clearing, surrounded by a copse of pine
trees stretching out around you.  Their limbs shelter you from the
brilliant sun overhead, but not enough to block you completely from the
warmth of the day.  Bouquets of flowers of all shapes and aromas have been
placed around the area, and the fragrance, mingled with the aroma of
pine, greets you with a most pleasant scent.  The hues of the flowers
seem more vibrant as well, a diversity from the bright yell to dull red;
from a brilliant purple to a soft orange, a cacophany of tone and shade.
As you glance around and turn your attention away from the flowers, you
also notice that pews have been placed in the clearing, and a small altar
rests at the center.  The pews look to have been carved out of the very
trees themselves, you see no lines that would suggest a harsh cutting.
Near the edge of the clearing there is a small stream which flows along
and into the thicket.
