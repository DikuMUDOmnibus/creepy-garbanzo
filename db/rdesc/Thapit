`@M`2ountain `@D`2ew `7cans.  Laundry, some `8dirty`7, some `&clean`7.
This is what you see when you enter the PiT that is my room.
An alter <? if that is what you can call it, with shit strewn about all over> to
my lord and master, the highness that is L`8o`&k`7i is against one side.
.                 <----------------------->                               .
Costumes.  Fake blood?  a pinstripe suit.  A bottle of Tequila, half empty.
pictures of mangled bodies, things unimaginable to the human body.
This is what you would see if you were here.  but you aren't.
because this doesn't exist.  This isn't the PiT.  or is it?
`#AND THIS ROOM DESCRIPTION SUCKS, I KNOW IT. SO SHUT UP.`7
