Which describes how yer feeling all the time.
Which describes how yer feeling all the, feeling all the time.
There's this guy and this guy, he makes you want to, want to, make you cry like the time
Which describes how yer feeling all the time.
When you sigh at the cracks in the ceiling all the time.
You said I'm feeling fine, but it didn't really rhyme, didn't rhyme overseas.
Which describes how yer feeling all the time.
When you lie at the cracks in the ceiling all the time.
But your lie didn't rhyme with the word overseas, overseas... There's this guy
Who describes how yer feeling all the time.
In his mind he can find how yer feeling all the time.
From behind mystic lines, even straighter than his spine.
Which is fine.
Which is fine.
And describes... how yer feeling... .all the tiiiiiiiiime.
