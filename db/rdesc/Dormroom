Well, It would appear that Shtik has moved on to college as well.  His lofted
beds are against either wall, and there are empty `@M`2ountain `@D`2ew`7 cans
all over the room.  His roommate Shane turns as you enter, nods slightly, and turns
back to Mirc where he is leeching someone's computer for some various software
You notice the Che Guevara and John Belushi posters on the wall, and can't help
but to think that this Shtik guy is one cool fucker
Also crouching in the corner of the room, wishing he could stay here all the time
is Drumondd, he catches your eye, winks, and goes back to talking to Shane, although
the whole while looking as if he is about to kick the long haired boy in the teeth.
Suicide is never the answer little buddy!
