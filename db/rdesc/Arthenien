`6You find yourself wrapped in a dark `8shadowy `6cave. The only `3l`#i`7g`&h`3t `6comes from a giant `5(`Phumming`5) `Po`5r`&b `6in the far east of the cave. In the middle of the cave 
sits a tome with a large `8black `6book that is `7i`&n`8s`7c`&r`8i`7b`&e`8d `6with `Of`4o`7r`&e`7i`4g`On `6writings.
As you wander further into the deep cave you come across a huge `^c`7r`&y`7s`^t`8a`7l clear `Ol`4a`Ok`4e `6with a large `7stone `6bridge passing over it into another series of tunnels. 
At the end of the western tunnel you come across `8A`7rthenien`8'`7s `6massive `Ol`4a`7i`&r `6which has bones of past night's `7m`&e`8a`7l`&s `6and a huge nest buried in the middle of the floor.``
