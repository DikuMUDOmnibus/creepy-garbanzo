`&"``Won`&'``t fall in Love today`&"``

Baby don`&'``t you be `4blue``
You know that I`&'``ll always be true
You know that I`&'``ll always love you
And we`&'``ll always be together too

Over a thousand things I can say to you
Half of which would be un`&-``true
But the one thing for sure I can say
Is that I won`&'``t fall in love today

Baby when you hold me tight
You know everything will be all right
So let`&'``s not take any time to fight
Because you know I love you with all my might

Baby you make me feel like a man
When we`&'``re rolling in the sand
So come and take me by the hand
And do the things you know we can
