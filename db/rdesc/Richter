You now stand within the `1bowels`` of the `3G```#r```8e```#a```3t`` `3W```#y```3r```#m``'s cave. Immediately,
your nose becomes assulted by a combination of various scents ranging
from `8charred`` rock to.....Mary Jane?  Sure enough, in the back of the
lair, amidst all the gold and jewels that any man or woman could desire
are some of the BIGGEST `2pot plants`` you have EVER seen!  Perfect stalks
reach towards the ceiling of this cave, where a large opening has been
made, to allow `#sunlight`` in.  Aside from this astounding sight, is an
extremely `8charred`` area in the northern part of the cave.  It would be
safe to assume that this section of the cave is meant for [`^A```6R``MA`6D```^A``]
gatherings, for it is far away from the treasure, and tempers of `2d```3r```2a```3g```2o```3n```2s``
tend to `1flare`` at times.
