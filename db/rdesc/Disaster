Your jaw drops as you look amongst the rubble and ruin that used to be Neme's room.
It looks like Mierda's thrown another of his wild parties, damn him.
It even still smells like llamas in here... Phew!
Under a pile of empty Dr. Pepper cans you find your remote, the 3 button is missing... 
Bongs, roaches, half toasted bowls among other smokIng utensIls remaIn scattered
Your favorites bras have been converted into double barrel slingshots, using all your favorite GurlPower CD's as ammo.
a small fire smoulders in the corner, where your couch used to be.
Oh... Mierda will pay!
A small shaved wombat sIts In the other corner of your room, quIverIng In fear.
Coby's opIum pIpe Is stIll attached to the ceIlIng fan.. you better duck.
A picture of Camilla and Mierda, being all cute with their poopie-pants, hangs on the wall.
