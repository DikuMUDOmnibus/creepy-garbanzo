This room is chilly.  A strange presence floats in the air.  It's almost like you're in a foreign world.  This is the land of the spirits, a place where the young meet with the old.  This land, far from Hyrule, contains the power of the Triforce
A small pedestal sits in the middle, with the medals of the sages, and the triforce set upon it.  As you look around, you feel empowered with a strange being, and reverance fills the room.
