As you enter this room, you notice alot of magic cards strung out here
and there.  Is that a starter box with a deck in it over there?
	The main color of magic cards you see are `4blue``.  Then as you look
some more, you notice some cd's.  They come in a variety, but mainly rock and
ICP.  Then you notice a T.V. and playstation.  There are several games on the
playstation, ranging from Final Fantasy VII to Diablo to Road Rash.  Then
there's a boom box on top of the T.V. playign ICP.  On the other end of the 
room sits `!M`Oa`!r`Oa`!x`Ou`!s`` at his crappy computer, typing away.  He turns
to you and says "May I help you?"
