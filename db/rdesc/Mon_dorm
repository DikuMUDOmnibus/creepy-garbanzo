The first thing that crosses your mind when you enter
this room is '`PHow the fuck does anyone LIVE in such a
small room?!?``'  The 8 ft. x 14 ft. dorm room is barely
large enough to fit the residence hall's furniture in, let
alone have personal belongings of the students who live
there.  But none the less, `#M`@o`#nrick`` has found a way to
cram some of his favorite things in the small living space.
Music is playing from the rather large `&S`7U`&B`7W`&O`7O`&F`7E`&R`` tucked away
under Monny's desk, and you can feel the bass thumping in your
chest.  A figure sits at the computer, typing away, and almost
doesn't notice you enter.  When he sees your reflection in the
window, he turns to see what you want, figuring you have come
to him for computer advice like the rest of the goddamn floor.
But you can tell that he's a nice guy under it all....
 
Or is he? ..........
