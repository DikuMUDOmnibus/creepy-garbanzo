`&You can't bring me down.``

Just cause you don't understand what's going on
don't mean it don't make no sense
and just cause you don't like it, don't
mean it ain't no good
and let me tell you something
before you go taking a walk in my world
you better go taking a look at the real world
cause this ain't no Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood
Can you say 'feel like shit?'
Yeah maybe sometimes i do feel like shit
I ain't happy 'bout it, but I'd rather feel like shit than be fulla shit
and if i offended you, oh, i'm sorry
but maybe you need to be offended
but here's my apology, and one more thing, `&FUCK YOU!``
Cause you can't bring me down.
