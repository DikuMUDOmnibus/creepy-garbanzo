You are standing amongst pine trees, in a small clearing beside a creek, 
surrounded by tall pine trees and a steady mist from the waterfall seems 
to rain down upon you here.  Before you there is a small isle, which 
overhangs the waterfall where the creek empties off.  Upon the isle is a 
single pine, crooked and bent with age, and beneath it a single silver 
flower, which seems to glow in the light of the sun shining down upon 
it.  You also see a path that leads to your northeast and it seems to 
venture out along a ridge to where another path branches down along a  
steep cliff, to below where a pool has formed from the waters.
As you glance around, you can tell that there has been some recent 
activity here, as right beside the bank of the creek there is a circle 
of rocks and in the center, charred and burnt wood, the signs of a 
recent camp fire.  Also, you can see where there was a blanket spread out 
on the ground, the pine needles cleaned away and the imprint of the 
blanket still visible.
