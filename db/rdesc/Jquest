You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of `1B`!oom.``
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing gods, giants and peasants.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD 
SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.

This week, letters D, E, F and G...keep collectin!
