You're standing in a fairly bare room, with walls made of a particularly
dark, ebon-hued marble.  The walls seem to absorb the very light around you,
as if the light itself had succumbed to the sense of forboding which
surrounds you.  In the center of the room, a forest-green marble casket, which
seems to be the center of the evil that fills the room with its presence.
There doesn't seem to be an exit, or escape, from this dark place and you
have to wonder for what reason you have been brought here.  Perhaps as a
witness to what lies beyond, or perhaps for something much darker; some ritual
long thought forgotten and best left in the past.  You peer to read the writing
inscribed upon the casket, but cannot make out the words--the room  far too
dark to provide the light needed to read for your mortal eyes.
