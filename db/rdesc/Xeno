You begin to feel intense hatred as you scan this domicile.
It is the attic of some large mansion, with only one window at
the end of the room looking out onto the Garden District Cemetary.
The altar at the other end of the room contains many strange
objects, amoung them, a small idol of the Virgin Mary and a 
`@Pickle Jar`` containing a black widow spider.  
Bizarre slogans are written on the walls in everything from
crayon to glitter pen.  It seems to be a nice place to
hang yourself from the ceiling.
