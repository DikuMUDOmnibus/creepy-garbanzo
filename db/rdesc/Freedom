`&F`` is for fighting,
`&R`` is for red, ancestors' blood in battle they shed
`&E`` we elect them
`&E`` we eject them in the land of the free and the home of the brave
`&D`` for your dying
`&O`` your overture
`&M`` they will cover your grave with manure

This spells out `&FREEDOM`` and it's nothing to me,
as long as there's a `1P`&.`1M`&.`1R`&.`1C`&.``
